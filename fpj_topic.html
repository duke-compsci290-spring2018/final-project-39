        Living in a large community, sometimes it is not easy to track what’s going on around us. For example, living in a big and diverse university, there are so many things happening on campus. A sports match, a Ted Talk, or even a party, some people can easily miss any one of their favorite things or opportunities here. Moreover, some people might find trouble of getting information and feeling detached from the community. Therefore, we are going to design an event and location driven web application called What’s Happening.
      </p>

      <p class="block">
        Essentially, the way this app works is that it integrates with Google Map and the events people posted. In details, without signing up or logging in, everyone is able to see a scaled local map where an event will be coming on the main page. If the user signs in, he/she is able to post events instead of just reading events. In terms of some additionally features, first is people can filter events on the map based on the categories of the events, the starting time of the events, and the capacity of the event. Second feature is that once user is logged in, he/she can track all of the history of the events he/she has attended. There will be more features coming up as we design our app.
      </p>

      <p class="block">
        In terms of the data source we are going to use beyond users’ input data. First is the Google Map API. Another API we are potentially going to use is Wunderground API, which is able to update the local weather constantly. Last API is about Yelp API, since food is big part of our lives, we will able to provide coupons to users based on their location.
